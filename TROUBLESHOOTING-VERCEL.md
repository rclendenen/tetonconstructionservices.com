# Vercel 404 Error - Troubleshooting Guide

## Step 1: Check Deployment Status

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Sign in if needed

2. **Find Your Project**
   - Look for: `tetonconstructionservices` (or similar name)
   - Click on it

3. **Check Latest Deployment**
   - Look at the top deployment entry
   - Check the status:
     - üü° **"Building"** or **"Queued"** = Still working, wait a bit
     - ‚úÖ **"Ready"** with green checkmark = Deployment succeeded
     - ‚ùå **"Failed"** or **"Error"** = Build failed, check logs

## Step 2: Find the Correct URL

### If Deployment Shows "Ready":

Your site URL will be shown in the deployment. It should look like:
- `https://tetonconstructionservices-XXXXX.vercel.app` (with random characters)
- OR `https://tetonconstructionservices.vercel.app`

**To find it:**
1. In Vercel dashboard, click on your project
2. Look for the "Visit" button at the top
3. Or look for "Domains" section - copy the `.vercel.app` URL

### If You See Multiple URLs:

Vercel creates a unique URL for each deployment. Use the one marked as "Production" or the most recent one.

## Step 3: Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue A: Deployment Still Building
**Symptoms:** Can't access site, 404 error
**Solution:** Wait 3-5 minutes, then refresh

### Issue B: Build Failed
**Symptoms:** Red X or "Error" status in Vercel
**Solution:** 
1. Click on the failed deployment
2. Read the error logs
3. Let me know what the error says

### Issue C: Wrong URL
**Symptoms:** 404 with error code like "NOT_FOUND"
**Solution:** Get the correct URL from Vercel dashboard

### Issue D: Deployment Not Started
**Symptoms:** No new deployment after git push
**Solution:**
1. Check if Vercel is connected to your GitHub repo
2. Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Git
3. Verify repository is connected

## Step 4: How to Get Your Correct URL

### Method 1: From Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your project name
3. Click the "Visit" button (or "View Deployment")
4. This opens your live site

### Method 2: From Deployments Tab
1. In your project, click "Deployments"
2. Find the one marked "Production" with green checkmark
3. Click the domain name shown
4. Copy that URL

### Method 3: From Project Settings
1. In your project, click "Settings"
2. Click "Domains"
3. Look for the `.vercel.app` domain
4. That's your URL

## Step 5: Verify Everything Works

Once you have the correct URL:

‚úÖ **Test these pages:**
- Homepage: `https://your-url.vercel.app/`
- About: `https://your-url.vercel.app/about`
- Services: `https://your-url.vercel.app/services`
- Projects: `https://your-url.vercel.app/projects`
- Contact: `https://your-url.vercel.app/contact`

## What That Error Code Means

The error you saw:
```
404: NOT_FOUND
Code: NOT_FOUND
ID: cle1::672zh-1761006287803-6112d41c8b9f
```

This typically means:
- The URL doesn't exist or is incorrect
- The deployment hasn't been created yet
- You're accessing a preview URL that has expired

## Next Steps

1. **Check Vercel Dashboard** - Is deployment "Ready"?
2. **Get Correct URL** - Use "Visit" button in dashboard
3. **If Build Failed** - Share the error logs with me
4. **If Still 404** - Double-check you're using the URL from Vercel dashboard
